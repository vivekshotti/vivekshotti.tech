            ><br /><br />

            Language to me has been a fascinating thing since childhood. <br /><br />
            As millenials go, I can’t proudly claim myself to be proficient of any
            language. Not of my mother toungue (Kannada which I can only hear and
            understand, and speak the bare minimum), nor my second language (Hindi,
            which I have the ability to write, comprehend, speak and listen, but real
            Hindi has roots in Urdu and Pure Hindi is as rare to the ears as Astatine
            is on Earth. Nor can I claim to surpass my expectations in English (I can
            write and comprehend this language but I tumble and take long weird gaps
            to single-down on my thoughts).<br /><br />

            Anyways let’s start from the world and narrow-down to my mother
            toungue.<br /><br />

            Today the whole world language system is a evolved advanced form of what
            we now call Indo-European Language Family. As can be figured out from the
            below representation it is colored in Asda Green:<br /><br />

            <img src="../../assets/blogs/b1.1.png" class="mx-auto border-2 border-black"/> <br />

            The Indo-European Dialect is far flung; from as east as Siberia (Russia)
            to as West as the United States itself; as North as Finland & Norway to as
            south as Latin America, Cape of Good Hope and maybe the early settlers of
            Antartica & Mars shall also speak this family. <br /><br />

            As you can see from the map, majority of India speaks the Indo-Eurpoean
            Family. But as you move south of India you see a part of India that is
            shaded uniquely olivish-green color. Nowhere in the map except the South
            of India could you find this hue, because this family of languages is
            unique to this place. <br /><br />

            Its the **Dravidian Family of Languages** encompassing majorly of the
            languages Telugu, Kannada, Tamil & Malyalam. Here green symbolizes north
            parts, yellow the central parts, orange the south central parts and red
            the south parts.<br /><br />

            Kannada is a lesser known language amongst the Dravidian spoken
            family of languages, but lies at the heart of it. Other Dravidian
            Languages such as Tamil can be dated back to 1st Century BC , but Kannada
            would not exist for nearly a century. The early forms of identifiable
            pieces of the Kannada dialect can be found on the Ashoka Rock Edict at
            Brahmagiri which is dated back to 230 BC. <br /><br />
            
            Since then Kannada has evolved.<br /><br />
